"""Signal processing helpers like wavelet denoiser functions.

Reusable **signal-processing helpers** that operate on NumPy tensors and do not
depend on MNE or PyTorch. The functions here may be called from any pipeline,
any model, or even from external notebooks.

Currently the module offers:

* :pyfunc:`wavelet_denoise` â€“ simple multi-level Daubechies denoising that
  keeps only the approximation coefficients (low-frequency content).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.array
        The MEG signal data with shape (n_trials, n_channels, n_times).
    wavelet : str
        The type of wavelet to use (e.g., 'db4' for Daubechies-4).
    level : int
        The level of decomposition to perform.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.array
        The denoised data.

    Examples
    --------
    ```python
    # Denoise the data assuming 'data' is the MEG data array with shape
    # (n_trials, n_channels, n_times)
    denoised_data = wavelet_denoise(data, 'db4', 2)
